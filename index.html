                I do not currently have any job experience because I've mostly worked on hobby/passion projects,
                none of which I've been wise enough to save. I'm specifically taking classes at Epicodus both to build an actual portfolio, and
                because accountability and physically going every day makes me considerably more productive.
                Additionally, since very little of my experience is in front end development, this particular track
                is about shoring up a weakness of mine which should make me considerably more well rounded.

          <p>
            Generally I'm a quiet and rather private person. Most of my interests and hobbies tend to be
            solo activities. Reading, jogging, and gaming typically. I don't intend to paint myself as anti-social because
            I am definitely not. I maintain a fairly positive attitude at all times and am extremely patient and calm.
            What I personally view as my most useful skills are: I am an very fast typer. On a keyboard I've
            gotten used to I can generally hit around 120 wpm. I'm also capable of working effectively with just about anyone.
            Between my generally easy going personality, extreme patience, willingness to either take charge or sit back and let someone else
            take charge, and ability to translate just about any topic I have experience in into plain English I haven't run into a single person I can't work well with.
            But I think my best skill is my incredible consistency. Once I've internalized a concept I just about never make an error with it ever again.
