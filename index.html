                I do not currently have any job experience because I've mostly worked on hobby/passion projects,
                none of which I've been wise enough to save. I'm specifically taking classes at Epicodus both to build an actual portfolio, and
                because accountability and physically going every day causes me to be considerably more productive.
                Additionally, since very little of my experience is in front end development, this particular track
                is about shoring up a weakness of mine which should make me considerably more well rounded.
                I also tend to be an extremely quick study and can generally pick up the syntax differences in a previously unused language quickly.

                  Generally I'm a quiet and rather private person. Most of my interests and hobbies tend to be
                  solo activities. Reading, jogging, and gaming typically. I don't intend to paint myself as anti-social because
                  I am definitely not. I maintain a fairly positive attitude at all times and am extremely patient and calm.
                  I also make an active effort to keep myself healthy, generally preparing healthy meals for myself and getting at least some exercise daily.
                  <br><br>What I personally view as my most useful skills are: I am an extremely fast typer. On a keyboard I've
                  gotten used to I can generally hit around 120 words per minute. This tends to lead to me completing most work I do rather quickly.
                  I'm also capable of working effectively with just about anyone. Between my generally easy going personality, extreme patience, willingness to either take charge or sit back and let someone else
                  take charge, and ability to translate just about any topic I have experience in into plain English I haven't run into a single person I can't work well with.
                  I'm also completely unafraid to try something new. I'm completely okay with diving into things I have very little chance at succeeding with because the lessons learned from failure are immense.
                  I think this both helps me learn better and gives me the humility I need to keep myself from becoming overconfident. I'm creative enough at finding solutions to problems
                  to complete most tasks, but I'm also capable of recognizing when the solution I've used is not a good one.
                  I think my best skill is my incredible consistency though. Once I've internalized a concept I just about never make an error with it ever again.
